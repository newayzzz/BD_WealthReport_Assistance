**Oitijhho AI | ঐতিহ্য AI | HeritageAI**

## 💰 Wealth_report_Agent + Digital_will_creator  

A 🇧🇩 Bengali-first AI tool to organize family wealth, track assets, and simplify inheritance planning — so families aren’t left in the dark during times of grief.

---

## 🧩 Problem

In many Bengali families, financial assets are fragmented across LICs, PFs, gold, SIPs, FDs, land, loans, and bank accounts — usually with little to no centralized documentation. Often, only one person knows the full picture. When that person passes away, others are left struggling.

This project was inspired by personal hardship — when our family lost our father in 2017. My mother, sister (then with a newborn in the UK), and I (based in Canada) had to navigate inheritance paperwork, nominee forms, and power of attorney signatures while dealing with grief and uncertainty. The goal is to ensure no one else has to face that confusion, inshaAllah.
